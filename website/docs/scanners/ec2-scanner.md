## Security Implications

### Attack Vectors

1. **Brute Force Attacks**: Open SSH ports are targets for credential attacks
2. **Automated Scanning**: Internet-wide scanning tools identify open SSH ports
3. **Lateral Movement**: Compromised instances can be used to access other resources
4. **Data Exfiltration**: SSH access can be used to transfer sensitive data

### Compliance Impact

- **PCI DSS**: Requires restricted access to cardholder data environments
- **SOC 2**: Mandates logical access controls and network restrictions
- **ISO 27001**: Requires network access control policies
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Recommends restricting SSH access to specific networks

## Remediation Strategies

### 1. IP Address Whitelisting

Replace broad access with specific IP ranges:

**Before:**
```
Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (everywhere)
```

**After:**
```
Source: 203.0.113.0/24 (your office network)
Source: 198.51.100.50/32 (specific admin IP)
```

### 2. Bastion Host Architecture

Implement a secure bastion host pattern:

```
Internet ‚Üí Bastion Host (restricted IPs) ‚Üí Private Instances
         (SSH from office only)    (SSH from bastion only)
```

**Benefits:**
- Single point of SSH access control
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Reduced attack surface

### 3. VPN-Based Access

Use VPN for administrative access:

```
Admin ‚Üí VPN Gateway ‚Üí Private Network ‚Üí EC2 Instances
       (authenticated)  (internal IPs)   (no public SSH)
```

### 4. AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

Replace SSH with Systems Manager Session Manager:

**Advantages:**
- No inbound ports required
- IAM-based access control
- Full session logging
- Browser-based access

```bash
# Connect via SSM instead of SSH
aws ssm start-session --target i-1234567890abcdef0
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Port Detection

While the current scanner focuses on SSH (port 22), you can extend it to detect other critical ports:

```python
# Additional ports to check
CRITICAL_PORTS = {
    22: "SSH",
    3389: "RDP (Windows Remote Desktop)",
    3306: "MySQL Database",
    5432: "PostgreSQL Database", 
    6379: "Redis",
    27017: "MongoDB"
}
```

### Protocol-Specific Analysis

```python
# Check for different protocol exposures
def analyze_protocol_exposure(permission):
    protocol = permission.get('IpProtocol')
    
    if protocol == '-1':  # All protocols
        return "All protocols exposed"
    elif protocol == 'tcp':
        return analyze_tcp_ports(permission)
    elif protocol == 'udp':
        return analyze_udp_ports(permission)
```

## Integration with AI Analysis

When run with AI analysis (`--ai` flag), the EC2 scanner provides:

### Enhanced Analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Detailed explanation of network security risks
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding of your infrastructure patterns
- **Prioritized Remediation**: Step-by-step fixes ordered by importance
- **Compliance Mapping**: How findings relate to security frameworks

### Example AI Report

```markdown
## EC2 Security Group Analysis

### Executive Summary
Your network configuration shows 3 security groups with SSH access 
exposed to the internet, creating significant security risks...

### Risk Level: HIGH

### Detailed Analysis
The identified security groups allow SSH access from any internet address,
making your instances vulnerable to brute force attacks and unauthorized access...

### Priority Actions
1. Immediately restrict SSH access to known IP ranges
2. Implement bastion host architecture for secure access
3. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
4. Consider AWS Systems Manager for serverless remote access
```

## Best Practices

### Before Scanning
1. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure scanner has `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups` permission
2. **Multi-Region**: Consider scanning all AWS regions where you have resources
3. **VPC Coverage**: Ensure all VPCs are included in the scan

### Interpreting Results
1. **Context Matters**: Consider the purpose of each security group
2. **Environment Classification**: Production systems require stricter controls
3. **Access Patterns**: Legitimate admin access may show as findings

### Taking Action
1. **Test Changes**: Verify access works after restricting security groups
2. **Communication**: Notify teams before changing network access
3. **Backup Access**: Ensure alternative access methods before removing SSH
4. **Monitor Changes**: Watch for connection issues after modifications

## Performance Considerations

### API Limits
- EC2 `DescribeSecurityGroups` has a rate limit of 100 requests per second
- Large accounts with many security groups may require throttling
- Consider paginated requests for accounts with 1000+ security groups

### Optimization Tips
```python
# Batch process security groups
def scan_in_batches(security_groups, batch_size=50):
    for i in range(0, len(security_groups), batch_size):
        batch = security_groups[i:i + batch_size]
        process_batch(batch)
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Rate limiting
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Security Groups Found**
```
‚úÖ EC2 report generated at scan/results/ec2_scan.json (0 issues found)
```
- **Cause**: No security groups with SSH open to internet
- **Action**: This is good - your network is properly secured

**Permission Denied**
```
ClientError: User is not authorized to perform: ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups
```
- **Cause**: Insufficient EC2 permissions
- **Solution**: Add `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups` permission

**Empty Security Groups**
```
No security groups returned from API
```
- **Cause**: No EC2 resources in the current region
- **Solution**: Check other AWS regions or verify resource existence

### Debugging Tips

```bash
# Check security groups manually
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --query 'SecurityGroups[?IpPermissions[?FromPort==`22` && IpRanges[?CidrIp==`0.0.0.0/0`]]]'

# List all security groups
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[].GroupId'
```

## Extended Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# monitor-sg.sh - Check for new SSH exposure

# Run scan
python -m scan.scan_ec2

# Check for new issues
CURRENT_ISSUES=$(cat scan/results/ec2_scan.json | jq length)
PREVIOUS_ISSUES=$(cat scan/results/ec2_scan_previous.json | jq length 2>/dev/null || echo 0)

if [ "$CURRENT_ISSUES" -gt "$PREVIOUS_ISSUES" ]; then
    echo "üö® New SSH exposure detected!"
    # Send alert
fi

# Save current state
cp scan/results/ec2_scan.json scan/results/ec2_scan_previous.json
```

### Integration with AWS Config

```json
{
  "ConfigRuleName": "ssh-restricted-check",
  "Description": "Checks whether security groups allow unrestricted SSH access",
  "Source": {
    "Owner": "AWS",
    "SourceIdentifier": "INCOMING_SSH_DISABLED"
  },
  "Scope": {
    "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
      "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Advanced Technical Features

### **Multi-Vulnerability Detection Logic**
The scanner uses **independent security checks** rather than exclusive if/elif logic, ensuring comprehensive vulnerability detection:

```python
# Advanced rule analysis - detects ALL applicable issues
def _analyze_rule(self, sg_id, sg_name, from_port, to_port, protocol, cidr, ip_version):
    """Analyze individual security group rule - checks ALL applicable vulnerabilities"""
    
    # Check 1: All traffic open (CRITICAL)
    if protocol == '-1' or (from_port == 0 and to_port == 65535):
        self.add_finding(severity='CRITICAL', title='All Traffic Open to Internet')
    
    # Check 2: Critical ports (independent check)
    if from_port == to_port and from_port in self.CRITICAL_PORTS:
        self.add_finding(severity='CRITICAL', title=f'{port_name} Port Open to Internet')
    
    # Check 3: Wide port ranges (if not already all traffic)
    if (to_port - from_port > 100) and not all_traffic_detected:
        self.add_finding(severity='HIGH', title='Wide Port Range Open to Internet')
```

### **Security Scoring Algorithm**
Enterprise-grade risk scoring with weighted vulnerability assessment:

```python
def generate_security_score(self):
    """Risk-based security scoring (0-100)"""
    # Weighted scoring: Critical=10, High=5, Medium=2, Low=1
    weighted_issues = (critical * 10) + (high * 5) + (medium * 2) + (low * 1)
    score = max(0, 100 - min(100, weighted_issues * 2))
    
    # Risk level classification
    if score < 30: risk_level = 'CRITICAL'
    elif score < 50: risk_level = 'HIGH'
    elif score < 70: risk_level = 'MEDIUM'
    else: risk_level = 'LOW'
```

### **Compliance Mapping Engine**
Automatic mapping of findings to security frameworks:
- **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark**: 4.1-4.2 (Network Access)
- **GDPR**: Data protection and encryption requirements
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data security mandates
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment card industry standards
- **SOC 2**: System and organization controls
