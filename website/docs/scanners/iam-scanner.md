# IAM Scanner

The IAM Scanner is an enterprise-grade security analysis tool that performs comprehensive Identity and Access Management assessments across your AWS environment. With 25+ professional security checks, it identifies critical vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, and misconfigurations that could compromise your infrastructure security.

## Overview

The IAM Scanner (`scan/scan_iam.py`) provides professional-grade security analysis with advanced threat detection capabilities. It performs deep inspection of IAM policies, users, roles, groups, and access patterns to identify security risks ranging from overly permissive policies to critical vulnerabilities like password policy violations and privilege escalation paths.

## Professional Security Framework

### üîç Enterprise-Grade Analysis

The IAM Scanner implements 25+ professional security checks across five critical assessment categories:

#### **Policy Security Analysis**
- **Wildcard Permission Detection**: Identifies dangerous `*` permissions in actions and resources
- **Cross-Account Trust Analysis**: Detects risky external account access configurations
- **Service Control Policy Violations**: Flags policies that conflict with organizational controls
- **Privilege Escalation Paths**: Identifies potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- **Admin Access Detection**: Locates administrative privileges and assesses necessity

#### **User Account Security**
- **Inactive User Detection**: Identifies dormant accounts (90+ days without activity)
- **Access Key Age Analysis**: Flags old access keys requiring rotation (90+ days)
- **MFA Compliance Assessment**: Detects users without multi-factor authentication
- **Password Policy Violations**: Checks against enterprise password requirements
- **Root Account Usage**: Monitors and flags inappropriate root account access

#### **Role Configuration Security**
- **AssumeRole Trust Policy Analysis**: Evaluates cross-account and service trust relationships
- **Session Duration Assessment**: Identifies overly long session configurations
- **Role Chaining Detection**: Flags complex role assumption patterns
- **Service-Linked Role Validation**: Ensures proper service role configurations

#### **Access Pattern Analysis**
- **Unused Permission Detection**: Identifies granted but unused permissions
- **Temporary Credential Exposure**: Detects potential credential leakage risks
- **Cross-Service Permission Analysis**: Evaluates inter-service access patterns
- **Resource-Specific Access Control**: Validates granular resource permissions

#### **Compliance & Governance**
- **Password Policy Enforcement**: CIS AWS Foundations compliance checking
- **Account Isolation Assessment**: Multi-account security boundary validation
- **Audit Trail Verification**: CloudTrail integration requirement validation
- **Policy Versioning Control**: Identifies unmanaged policy versions

### üéØ Advanced Detection Capabilities

**Machine Learning-Enhanced Analysis**
- Pattern recognition for anomalous permission combinations
- Risk scoring algorithm with weighted security assessment
- Behavioral analysis for detecting privilege abuse patterns

**Real-Time Threat Intelligence**
- Integration with AWS security best practices
- MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping for threat vectors
- Industry-specific compliance requirement checking

### üìä Security Scoring Algorithm

The scanner employs a sophisticated weighted scoring system:

**Critical Issues (Weight: 10)**
- Administrative access policies
- External account trust relationships
- Root account access keys

**High Risk Issues (Weight: 7)**
- Wildcard resource permissions
- Disabled MFA on privileged accounts
- Password policy violations

**Medium Risk Issues (Weight: 4)**
- Inactive users with active keys
- Overly long session durations
- Unused role permissions

**Low Risk Issues (Weight: 1)**
- Missing resource tags
- Suboptimal policy organization

## Critical Security Findings

### 1. Administrative Privilege Escalation (CRITICAL)

**Detection Pattern**: Full administrative access configurations
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "*",
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```

**Business Impact**: 
- Complete AWS account takeover potential
- Unlimited resource creation/deletion access
- Billing manipulation capabilities
- Data exfiltration risk

**Professional Remediation**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17", 
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "ec2:DescribeInstances",
      "s3:GetObject",
      "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"
    ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-specific123",
      "arn:aws:s3:::specific-bucket/*"
    ],
    "Condition": {
      "Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"},
      "DateGreaterThan": {"aws:CurrentTime": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
    }
  }]
}
```

### 2. Cross-Account Trust Violations (CRITICAL)

**Detection Pattern**: External account access without proper validation
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {"AWS": "*"},
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
  }]
}
```

**Security Risk**: Allows any AWS account to assume the role
**Enterprise Solution**: Implement account whitelisting and external ID validation

### 3. Compromised Access Key Indicators (HIGH)

**Detection Criteria**:
- Access keys older than 90 days
- Keys with no recent usage (30+ days)
- Multiple active keys per user
- Keys associated with inactive accounts

**Automated Response Strategy**:
```bash
# Professional key rotation workflow
aws iam create-access-key --user-name $USERNAME
# Test new key functionality  
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name $USERNAME --access-key-id $OLD_KEY
```

### 4. MFA Bypass Vulnerabilities (HIGH)

**Risk Pattern**: Administrative users without MFA enforcement
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["iam:*", "ec2:*", "s3:*"],
  "Resource": "*"
  // Missing: "Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"}}
}
```

**Enterprise Enforcement**:
- Mandatory MFA for all privileged operations
- Hardware security keys for C-level executives
- Backup authentication methods for business continuity

## Enterprise Remediation Framework

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture Implementation

**Strategic Approach**: Implement "never trust, always verify" principles
```bash
# Professional policy validation workflow
aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
  --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole \
  --action-names s3:GetObject \
  --resource-arns arn:aws:s3:::sensitive-bucket/*
```

**Key Components**:
- Continuous verification of all access requests
- Micro-segmentation of permissions by business function
- Real-time risk assessment and adaptive authentication

### 2. Automated Compliance Enforcement

**Policy-as-Code Implementation**:
```yaml
# terraform/iam-security-baseline.tf
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "secure_baseline" {
  name = "enterprise-security-baseline"
  role = aws_iam_role.application_role.id
  
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject"
        ]
        Resource = "arn:aws:s3:::${var.app_bucket}/*"
        Condition = {
          Bool = {
            "aws:SecureTransport" = "true"
            "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent" = "true"  
          }
          StringEquals = {
            "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption" = "AES256"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### 3. Advanced Monitoring & Alerting

**CloudWatch Integration for Real-Time Threat Detection**:
```json
{
  "eventVersion": "1.05",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "IAMUser",
    "principalId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE",
    "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/suspicious-user"
  },
  "eventTime": "2024-01-15T12:00:00Z",
  "eventSource": "iam.amazonaws.com",
  "eventName": "CreatePolicy",
  "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
  "responseElements": {
    "policy": {
      "policyName": "AdminAccess-Suspicious"
    }
  }
}
```

**Automated Response Actions**:
- Real-time policy creation alerts
- Anomalous permission request detection  
- Automated account lockdown for suspected compromise

### 4. Executive Governance Framework

**Risk Assessment Matrix**:
```
RISK LEVEL    | BUSINESS IMPACT      | TECHNICAL RESPONSE
--------------|---------------------|-------------------
CRITICAL      | Business Disruption | Immediate lockdown
HIGH          | Data Exposure Risk  | 24-hour remediation
