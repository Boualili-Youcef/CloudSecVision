# Introducing CloudSecVision - AWS Security Scanner with AI Analysis

We're excited to announce the release of **CloudSecVision**, a comprehensive AWS security scanning tool that combines automated vulnerability detection with AI-powered analysis to help organizations strengthen their cloud security posture.

<!--truncate-->

## Why CloudSecVision?

As AWS environments grow in complexity, maintaining security across multiple services becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional security tools often provide raw findings without the context needed to prioritize and remediate issues effectively. CloudSecVision bridges this gap by offering:

### 🔍 Comprehensive Scanning
- **IAM Policy Analysis**: Detect overly permissive policies and privilege escalation risks
- **EC2 Security Groups**: Identify network exposure and unauthorized access points  
- **S3 Bucket Security**: Assess data protection, encryption, and public access controls

### 🤖 AI-Powered Intelligence
- **Contextual Analysis**: Understand the business impact of security findings
- **Prioritized Recommendations**: Get ranked remediation steps based on risk and effort
- **Compliance Mapping**: Automatic alignment with SOC 2, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001 requirements

### 📊 Interactive Dashboard
- **Visual Analytics**: Streamlit-based dashboard with interactive charts and metrics
- **Real-time Updates**: Live scanning and result visualization
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate reports in multiple formats for stakeholders

## Key Features

### Multi-Service Security Assessment

CloudSecVision currently supports three critical AWS services:

**IAM Scanner** - Identifies policies with wildcard permissions (`"*"` in Action or Resource) that violate the principle of least privilege.

**EC2 Scanner** - Detects security groups allowing SSH access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0), a common attack vector.

**S3 Scanner** - Performs comprehensive bucket analysis including public access, encryption, versioning, logging, and lifecycle policies.

### AI Analysis with Ollama

Unlike traditional security scanners that dump raw findings, CloudSecVision uses local AI models through Ollama to provide:

- **Executive Summaries** for leadership
- **Technical Deep Dives** for security teams  
- **Step-by-step Remediation** with code examples
- **Compliance Impact Assessment** for audit preparation

### Easy Integration

```bash
# Quick start
git clone https://github.com/Boualili-Youcef/cloudsecvision.git
cd cloudsecvision
pip install -r requirements.txt
aws configure

# Run comprehensive scan
python main.py --service all --ai

# Launch dashboard
./run_dashboard.sh
```

## Real-World Impact

### Before CloudSecVision
- Manual security reviews taking weeks
- Raw findings without business context
- Difficulty prioritizing remediation efforts
- Limited compliance mapping

### After CloudSecVision  
- Automated daily security scans
- AI-powered risk assessment and prioritization
- Clear remediation roadmaps
- Automated compliance reporting

## Example AI Analysis

Here's what CloudSecVision's AI analysis provides for a typical IAM finding:

```markdown
## IAM Security Analysis

### Risk Level: HIGH

### Executive Summary
Your IAM configuration contains 2 overly permissive policies that grant 
wildcard permissions, creating significant security risks and potential 
compliance violations.

### Detailed Analysis
The identified policies "AdminAccess" and "TestTooPermissivePolicy" both 
use wildcard ("*") permissions for actions and resources, violating the 
principle of least privilege and creating potential attack vectors...

### Priority Actions
1. IMMEDIATE: Replace wildcard permissions with specific resource ARNs
2. SHORT-TERM: Implement policy conditions for time-based access
3. LONG-TERM: Deploy automated policy validation in CI/CD pipeline

### Compliance Impact
- SOC 2 CC6.1: Violates logical access security requirements
- PCI DSS 7.1: Fails least privilege access controls
- ISO 27001 A.9.1: Non-compliant access control policy
```

## Architecture and Design

CloudSecVision is built with a modular architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Scanners      │    │   AI Analyzer   │    │   Dashboard     │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
│ • IAM Scanner   │───▶│ • Ollama        │───▶│ • Streamlit     │
│ • EC2 Scanner   │    │ • Report Gen    │    │ • Visualizations│
│ • S3 Scanner    │    │ • Recommendations│   │ • Metrics       │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

Each component is designed to be:
- **Modular**: Easy to extend with new scanners
- **Scalable**: Handle large AWS environments efficiently  
- **Secure**: Read-only operations with no data transmission
- **Open**: Fully open-source with comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Ollama (optional, for AI analysis)

### Quick Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Boualili-Youcef/cloudsecvision.git
cd cloudsecvision

# 2. Set up environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure AWS
aws configure

# 4. Run your first scan
python main.py --service all
```
