## About the IAM Security Scanner

The IAM Security Scanner is a comprehensive tool for identifying security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. It helps organizations ensure their permission systems follow security best practices by detecting common issues such as:

- Missing boundary policies
- Role trust relationship issues
- Unused credentials and access keys

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Policy Analysis**: Checks for overly permissive policies
- **Severity Classification**: Prioritizes findings by security impact
